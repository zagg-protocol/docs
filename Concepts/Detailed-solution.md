Detailed Implementation Solution
================================
ZAGG Protocol is a derivation of Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) and achieves privacy with a hybrid model of Accounts & UTXOs with Zero knowledge proofs to shield UTXO based transactions. For the reference implementation, ZAGG Protocol takes primitives from ZCash Sapling project for the shielded transactions support.
